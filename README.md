Features Added

Video File Support
---

This fork of the harvard-lts/fits repository adds video validation for .mov and .mp4 files using ffmpeg and by extension ffprobe. In order to use the new tool both ffmpeg and ffprobe must be installed. Currently, this has only been tested on Mac OS X 9 and RHEL 6. 

This new tool could be adapted to validate other video formats, as the need arrises.
